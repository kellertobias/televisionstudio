# Lora Tally Node

This part of the Project is a little Device (and the software for it), that you can stick onto the camera
and Lights up if the camera is on Program or Preview.

This part consists of the `lora-node.ino`, the arduino sourcecode for the Wemos D1, a little Python Script for the
Raspberry Pi to test the nodes and of the schematics and board layout.
